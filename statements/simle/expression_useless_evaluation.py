âœ… Question 2: Useless Evaluation

x = 10
y = 20
x + y

Question:
What happens when this code is run in a .py file (not in the Python shell)?
Will it print or return anything? Why or why not?
'''

# This is a classic example for "Useless Evaluation"
# Nothing is printed at all
# No use of evaluation
# This is also an statement expression but 'Useless One'
