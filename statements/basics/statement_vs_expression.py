'''
1. “Expression is something that produces a value”
✅ Correct — an expression always evaluates to a value.

2. “Statements are instructions”
✅ Correct — a statement tells Python to perform an action.

3. “Statements tell Python to do something, It can be Check conditions, Return a value, Assign a value etc.”
🟨 Almost perfect.
✔️ Yes, statements can check conditions (if), assign (=), return (return), etc.
➕ Missing: statements can also define (def, class), import modules, handle errors (try/except), manage resources (with), and more.

4. “Every statement might have an expression but every expression might not be an statement.”
🟨 Slightly off in wording.
✔️ Correct idea: many statements contain expressions (e.g. if x > 0: contains expression x > 0).
❗ But not every statement has to include an expression (e.g. pass, break, continue don’t).

5. “One important thing to notice via an example is: 2+3 is different than x=2+3.”
✅ Perfect illustration.
✔️ 2+3 is just an expression.
✔️ x=2+3 is an assignment statement (that contains the expression 2+3).
