'''
ðŸ“Œ Simple Assignment (=)

1. Purpose
â€¢ Binds a name to an object (not copying the value)
x = 5    # x â†’ 5

2. Multiple Targets
â€¢ Many names can point to the same object
a = b = []   
a.append(1)
print(b)   # [1]

3. Assignment Targets
â€¢ Can assign to variables, attributes, items, or slices
obj.attr = 10
person["name"] = "Alice"
nums[1:3] = [20, 30]

4. Rebinding vs Mutation
â€¢ Rebinding â†’ name points to a new object
x = [1, 2]
x = [3, 4]      # x now points to a different list

â€¢ Mutation â†’ change the object itself
x = [1, 2]
x.append(3)     # same list changed â†’ [1, 2, 3]

â€¢ Mutation affects all names pointing to that object
a = b = [1]
a.append(2)
print(b)   # [1, 2]

5. Scope
â€¢ By default, assignment is local to the current function
x = 1
def f():
    x = 2   # local x, does not affect global x
