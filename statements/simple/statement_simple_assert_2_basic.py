âœ… Assertion Behavior
What will be the output of the following code?

x = 10
assert x > 5
print("Assertion passed!")

assert x < 5, "x must be less than 5"
print("This line prints?")
'''

x = 10
assert x > 5
print("Assertion passed!")

assert x < 5, "x must be less than 5"
print("This line prints?")

# Output: First "Assertion passed!" will be printed as x>5 is 10>5 (True)
# Then : AssertionError will be thrown, as x is not less than 5.
# And : "This line prints?" WON'T BE PRINTED.
