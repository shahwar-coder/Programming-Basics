'''
Q. What are syntax and semantics?
Ans:
- Syntax = the structure/rules of writing code.
- Semantics = the meaning of that code.

Example:
'''
# Syntax error:
print("Hello"   # ❌ missing parenthesis

# Semantic error:
print(2 / 0)    # Syntax is fine, but meaning invalid (ZeroDivisionError).

# Step-by-step:
# Syntax → “is this written correctly?”
# Semantics → “does this make sense when executed?”
